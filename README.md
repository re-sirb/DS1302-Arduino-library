# DS1302-Arduino-library

A simple and compact Arduino-library for interfacing with the ubiquitous DS1302 real time clock. For this it uses 3 freely selectable I/O pins. It provides basic functions to read and write date and time information.

## Using RTC_DS1302 Arduino-library

To read the current date/time from the DS1302-Chip you will have to execute *get_timestamp()*. After that you can access the new values. 

Have fun!
